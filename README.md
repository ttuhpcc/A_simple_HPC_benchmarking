# HPC_benchmarking
A simple ready-to-use collection of benchmarking tests for high-performance computing clusters for educational &amp; testing purposes. 
The list consists of the following software and sample codes:
* [Daniel] Tips for running [HPL Benchmarking](https://netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/)
* [Daniel] Tips for running [HPCG](https://www.hpcg-benchmark.org/)
* [Daniel, I can help] A sample code designed to call the subroutine library for [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/benchfft/) which is a fast Fourier transform for computing the discrete Fourier transform in multiple dimensions.
* Two specific sample examples of a popular opensource molecular dynamics program called [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org/#gsc.tab=0) originating from Sandia National Laboratory
* A relatively larger sample case from another parallelized opensource CFD software called [Openpipeflow](https://openpipeflow.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) which is flexible, fast, and captures rich details of the fluid dynamics and is used to investigate the fluid -flow dynamics for incompressible flow in a variety of regimes.
