# HPC_benchmarking
A simple ready-to-use collection of benchmarking tests for high-performance computing clusters for educational &amp; testing purposes. 
The list consists of the following software and sample codes:

* Benchmarking with HPL [HPL Benchmarking](./HPL/README.md)
    *  Tips for installation
    *  Running two kinds of benchmarks a) Multiple single-node runs, b) One large parallel multinode run   
* Tips for running [High Performance Conjugate Gradient](./HPCG/README.md)
* A sample code designed to call the subroutine library for [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/benchfft/) which is a fast fourier transform for computing the discrete Fourier transform in multiple dimensions.
* Two specific sample examples of a popular opensource molecular dynamics program called [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org/#gsc.tab=0) originating from Sandia National Laboratoy
* A relatively larger sample case from another parallelized opensource CFD software called [Openpipeflow](https://openpipeflow.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) which is flexible, fast, and caputres rich details of the fluid dynamics and is used to investigate thr fluid -flow dynamics for incompressible flow in a variety of regimes.
