The following benchmark consists of 
1. A single-core and
2. A multi-core
version of a sample MATLAB code script which can be used for benchmarking purposes.

The scripts `power_setting_benchmarking` and `matlab_test` are designed to run the matlab benchmark while cycling through different power performance modes.
